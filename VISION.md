Qubic Synthetic Pegged Asset Oracle Model
Objective:

Deploy a synthetic qAsset (e.g., qBTC) on Qubic that:

Is not redeemable for the real asset.

Maintains an accurate, immutable 1:1 peg with the external asset (BTC, ETH, etc) by price only.

Sources price from a quantum-proof, 0-fee, committee-verified, immutable “code is law” oracle.

Value is based on the price feed, not redeemability.

Design Principles
One-way bridge: No redemption; only price feeds and synthetic minting.

Quantum-proof verification: Use threshold signatures (e.g., via Pyth/Wormhole committee, or quantum-resistant signatures).

0 Fee Oracle:

Oracle contract on Qubic that can only update price if a quantum-proof signature threshold is met.

No user fees to update/query price (oracle maintenance paid by contract’s IPO or initial QUs, per Qubic’s design).

Immutability:

Oracle and asset logic can never be altered or admin-accessed after deployment.

“Code is law” enforced at contract level: upgradeability disabled, admin keys burned.

Absolute Math:

All balances, prices, and calculations use fixed-point arithmetic, maximum precision (at least 8 decimals for qBTC).

High-Level Flow
Oracle Contract:

Stores latest BTC/USD price, only updatable via quantum-proof threshold signature (e.g., 3-of-5 committee).

On-chain price history is optional but can be added.

qBTC Token Contract:

Standard Qubic C++ fungible token.

Mint fixed supply (e.g., 21,000,000 qBTC * 10^8 units), minted to deployer, then admin functions revoked.

Contract references oracle for price at any time.

No Fees/No Upgrades/No Owner:

All admin, upgrade, and fee features are permanently disabled post-launch.

Usage:

Anyone can query the current BTC price at 0.000000000000 fee

dApps can use qBTC as an accounting unit, pegged 1:1 by oracle price.
