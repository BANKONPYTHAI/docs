# BANKON PYTHAI

fixed total supply: 100,000.000000000000 BANKON PYTHAI<br />
one hundred thousand and twelve decimal places<br />

Specify immutability: no future minting

# Write Smart Contract

Develop contract in C++ per the Qubic standard

Implement fixed supply logic: only mint once, never again

Add core features: transfer, balanceOf, view totalSupply

Reserve admin functions only for the initial mint/distribution

# Develop Quantum Price Calculator Module

Architect a C++ module that:

Accepts input from multiple data feeds (BTC, USD, etc.)

Uses a custom algorithm to derive quantum-consistent price (minimizing manipulation risk)

Outputs reference prices for synthetic asset issuance and collateral checks

# Build Oracle System for Price Feeds

Design an on-chain oracle framework that:

Gathers prices from decentralized sources

Allows for cross-verification between sources and multi-sig data submission

Can lock and verify actual external value (e.g., tokens, coins) for synthetic minting

# Integrate Price Calculator and Oracle with Token Contract

Enable BANKON PYTHAI smart contract to:

Query the quantum price calculator for current reference prices

Verify collateralization or peg status using the oracle system

Support minting and redeeming synthetic assets (e.g., synthetic USD, BTC) based on reference prices

# Test Locally

Simulate oracle price updates and quantum calculator accuracy

Test token mint, transfer, and redemption functions

Test synthetic asset creation and settlement logic

# Deploy to Test Network

Launch full system (BANKON PYTHAI, price calculator, oracle) on Qubic testnet

Open for external audit and public review

Run battle-testing and edge case scenarios

# Launch on Main Network

Deploy BANKON PYTHAI contract with full supply

Activate the quantum price calculator and oracle modules

Distribute tokens as planned, ensuring all supply is accounted for

# Enable Synthetic Asset Minting

Open up the synthetic asset system

Allow users to lock value and mint synthetic tokens based on oracle prices

Regularly update and audit price feed sources

# Governance and Iteration

Publish open-source code and methodologies

Allow the community to propose upgrades or new synthetic pairs

Periodically review and improve the oracleâ€™s security and price algorithm

# Expand Utility

Enable staking, swaps, and advanced collateral management using the quantum-calculated synthetic prices

Encourage cryptosystem projects to use BANKON PYTHAI as reference value for their own assets
